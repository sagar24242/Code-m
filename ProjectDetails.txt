(1)  Documentation for HomePage Component


Overview
The HomePage component is a React functional component that serves as the landing page of a web application. It includes features like:

Email-based OTP (One-Time Password) authentication.
Google reCAPTCHA integration for bot verification.
Navigation links and user interactions.
A visually appealing layout divided into sections (Navbar, Left/Right Sidebar, Main Content, and Footer).
Component Features
The component is structured with several React hooks and JavaScript methods to manage states and events:

1. Imports
useState and useNavigate from React and React Router:
useState manages state variables such as email, OTP, timers, and visibility toggles.
useNavigate is used for programmatic navigation.
ReCAPTCHA from react-google-recaptcha to integrate Google's reCAPTCHA service for bot protection.
CSS file HomePage.css for styling.





2. State Variables
The component utilizes state variables for dynamic behavior:

email: Stores the email entered by the user.
otpInputVisible: Determines if the OTP input field is displayed.
otp: Stores the entered OTP.
isButtonDisabled: Disables the "Send OTP" button temporarily.
timer: A countdown timer for OTP resend.
captchaVisible: Controls the visibility of the reCAPTCHA widget.
recaptchaVerified: Tracks whether the reCAPTCHA was successfully verified.







3. Functions
3.1 OTP Functionality
handleSendOtp:

Validates the email input.
Simulates sending an OTP (can be replaced with a real API).
Displays the OTP input field and starts a 30-second timer during which the "Send OTP" button is disabled.
handleOtpSubmit:

Validates the OTP input.
Makes the CAPTCHA visible for further validation.
3.2 reCAPTCHA Validation
handleRecaptchaSuccess:

Triggered when reCAPTCHA verification is successful.
Sends the generated token to a backend endpoint (/api/user/validate-recaptcha/) for validation.
If successful, applies a blur effect to the background, sets the recaptchaVerified state, and navigates to the profile page.
addBlurEffect & removeBlurEffect:

Utility functions to add/remove a CSS class that applies a blur effect when the user interacts with the reCAPTCHA widget.
3.3 Navigation
handleLoginSignup:
Ensures reCAPTCHA verification before allowing navigation.
Navigates the user to the profile page upon successful verification.







4. JSX Structure
The component's UI is divided into the following sections:

4.1 Header (Navbar)
Left Section: Links to "Home" and "About."
Center Section: Displays a logo.
Right Section: Links to "Services" and "Contact," along with icons for wallet, notifications, and user avatar.


4.2 Main Content
Left Sidebar:

Download links for Windows/Mac applications.
Email input and OTP verification form with reCAPTCHA integration.
Center Section:

Community updates such as announcements, premium items, screenshots, and social media links.
Right Sidebar:

Displays other updates in card format.


4.3 Footer
Contains a copyright notice.






5. Styling
The component uses CSS for styling:

A file named HomePage.css is imported to handle layout, colors, and responsiveness.







6. Integration with Backend

The component assumes a backend API exists for:

OTP generation (not implemented in the code but simulated).
reCAPTCHA validation via http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/user/validate-recaptcha/.


=>How to Use
Install dependencies for React, React Router, and reCAPTCHA:
bash
Copy code
npm install react-google-recaptcha react-router-dom
Replace the RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY with your actual Google reCAPTCHA site key.
Ensure the backend API for OTP and reCAPTCHA validation is operational.
Add appropriate images and styles in ../styles/HomePage.css.

=>Future Enhancements
Replace OTP simulation with a real backend API.
Enhance the form validation and error handling.
Add responsiveness to improve mobile experience.
Include more robust token handling for reCAPTCHA.
This component demonstrates a simple yet effective way to combine email authentication, bot protection, and navigation in a React-based web application.

(2)Documentation for ProfilePage Component

Overview

The ProfilePage component is a React functional component designed to provide a structured user profile page. It contains a combination of user information, profile-related tasks, and interactive features like comments, tabs, and completion actions. The layout is divided into three main sections (Sidebar, Main Content, and Right Actions) with an additional footer.
